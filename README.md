# CryptoClustering
This challenge will allow us to implement our knowledge of python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.

## Data overview
- Find the Best Value for k Using the Original Scaled DataFrame
- Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the Original Scaled Data
- Optimize Clusters with Principal Component Analysis
- Find the Best Value for k Using the PCA Data
- Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the PCA Data
